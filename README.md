I'm a passionate programmer and recent graduate (Class of 2023) from CIEM. I’ve always been driven by creativity and problem-solving—whether it’s through code, storytelling, or game design.

💻 Programming: I enjoy building software that’s both functional and meaningful. I’m always exploring new technologies and working on personal projects to sharpen my skills.

🎮 Game Dev Aspirant: My dream has always been to create immersive gaming experiences. I regularly explore game engines and development tools, and I'm working toward turning that dream into reality.

✍️ Blogger: I run a blog where I write about the history of languages, art, movies, food, and games—blending my love for storytelling with curiosity about the world.

📺 YouTube Creator: I also have a small gaming channel where I share my adventures in single-player games and celebrate the narratives that make games unforgettable.
